                  <ol>
                    <li> Treat the fracture on the spot
                          Don’t move the patient till the injured part has been immobilised unless life is in immediate danger from some other cause.
                          If, however, circumstances are such that final immobilisation cannot be completed on the spot, carry out a temporary fix to enable the patient to be moved for a short distance to more suitable and safe surroundings.
                          Haemorrhage and severe wounds must be dealt with before continuing with the treatment of fractures, with due regard to requirements of both types of injuries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Steady and support the injured parts at once, so that movement is impossible.
                       This prevents further injury and the increase in the bleeding which always takes place at the site of the fracture.
                       It also prevents broken bone ends from piercing or damaging the skin, blood vessels, nerves or muscles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Immobilise the fracture by the use of bandages or the use of splints.
                      Using the patient’s body as a means of support, application of bandages would be adequate.
                      Additional support of splints may be required when there is a possibility of long or difficult transport before medical aid is possible.
                      Splints are required when both lower limbs are fractured.
                    </li>
